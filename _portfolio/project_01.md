<strong>Overview</strong>: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) has been investing in Electrified Aircraft Propulsion (EAP), which has led to conceptual aircraft designs intended to adopt partial or fully electric engines [1]. 
The High Efficiency Megawatt Motor (HEMM) lies within the scope of EAP, which has been conceptualized the meet the demands of the Single Aisle Turboelectric Aircraft with Aft Boundary Layer (STARC-ABL) or similar concepts [2]. 
The requirements of this rotor are high specific power, 16kW/kg electromagnetic weight) and high efficiency of approximately 99%. 
These requirements will make it possible to increase overall aircraft efficiency, reduce emissions, and decrease dependency on carbon-based fuels. 
To accomplish this, the conceptualized rotor leverages the properties of superconductors, metallic alloys, and composite materials.

I am working in a multidisciplinary team consisting of individuals responsible for electrical, magnetic, thermal, manufacturing, structural dynamic, and structural mechanics analyses. 
Within the multidisciplinary team, I am responsible for leading the structural mechanics analysis to reduce risk of damage and failure and successfully pass critical design review phase requirements. 
My responsibilities are to analyze the structural response of HEMM subjected to cryogenic temperatures while experiencing maximum design mechanical and pressure loads, analyze fasteners, fatigue life, and fracture mechanics of adhesive joints. 
My work involves the application of multiscale mechanics, elasticity, fracture mechanics, fatigue, finite element modeling, characterization of materials, and micromechanics, and optimization for light-weighting hardware. 
The outcome of my work results in guiding the design of the rotor system through re-design of critical elements, lightweighting to increase power density, communicating with key stakeholders to reduce scheduling risks, documenting findings and recommendations, and delivering presentations to a diverse group of engineers and technicians.
