<h6 style="text-align:left">Overview</h6>
<p style="text-align:justify">
The UAV club at the college of nanoscale science and engineering (CNSE) obtained sponsorship from the science technology entry program (STEP) for helping students conduct a scientific research project.
We planned for the students to learn about the atmosphere and physics of ballooning through a space balloon project.
Throughout the Spring 2016, the students and I would meet in a classroom and I would teach them the physics involved in weather balloons.
The students learned how to predict a weather balloon's flight pattern by accounting for wind direction and ascent velocity, and learned about the viable options for tracking the balloon during its ascent and descent phase.
The UAV club team members participating in this project met with students to discuss the plan on executing the launch and logistics.
When the launch date arrived, we successfully launched and retrieved the weather balloon and collected temperature, pressure, and radiation data from the atmosphere.
The students went on to present their research project findings at the STEP Statewide Student Conference and won first place!
We were extremely proud of the students and very happy to have had the opportunity to work as a team to make this launch successful.
Images of the space ballon project are shown below, and a short video of the ascent at the bottom.
