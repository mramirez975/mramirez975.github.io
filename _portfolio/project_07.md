<h6 style="text-align:left">Overview</h6>
<p style="text-align:justify">
The pin bracket project was a team effort at the end of the manufacturing of advanced composites class taught by Dr. R. Byron Pipes.
A pin bracket was selected as the part to manufacture using several methods, namely, autoclave, VARTM, and compression molding.
Regardless of the manufacturing method, the design was sufficiently challenging to manufacture because of its complex shape requiring accounting for polymer transition and heat transfer.
The outcome of the project was a manufactured pin bracket, with several lessons learned regarding ideal process parameters and ease of manufacturing.
In the end, all of the teams successfully manufactured a composite pin bracket, shared the analytical approach of selecting process parameters, and obtained experience manufacturing complex shaped composites.

<strong>Highlights</strong>:<br>
<ul style="text-align:left;margin-left:30px">
	<li>Characterized the polymer using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC)</li>
	<li>Calibrated polymer transition models (e.g., cure kinetics, rheology, etc.) to guide selection of manufacutring process parameters</li>
	<li>Manufactured complex shaped pin bracket design using compression molding</li>
	<li>Tested the mechanical properties of manufactured pin bracket to assess quality</li>
	<li>Inspected the manufactured pin bracket through microscopy analysis to identify consistency in pre-defined layup sequence</li>
	<li>Correlated tests and inspection to manufacturing process to consolidate our knowledge of modeling and manufacturing</li>
