<h6 style="text-align:left">Introduction</h6>
<p style="text-align:justify">
In traditional composite manufacturing, a prepreg is a pre-impregnated array of fibers (e.g., carbon, kevlar, glass etc.) with a polymer matrix.
Prepreg platelet refers to prepreg that has been chopped into rectangles or squares, usually recycled from lamina sheets cut for traditional hand layup processes.
These platelets can be molded into complex geometry by applying heat and pressure to force the chopped prepreg into a mold, the material is therefore referred to as prepreg platelet molded composite (PPMC).
PPMC has processing advantages in that it is relatively easy to manufacture complex-shaped geometries, which saves time and costs.
For ease of manufacturing, these platelets can be suspended into a mold in a stochastic manner to simplify the manufacturing process; however, platelets may be placed into a mold with pre-defined orientation stackup, like traditional hand layup, it can be time consuming.
Whether compression molded parts are engineered with a predefined stackup of platelets or manufactured with stochastic placement of platelets, these parts must be tested to verify structural integrity.
Experimental campaigns are time and cost intensive depending on the application.
Predictive tools for quantifying the structural integrity of PPMC have been developed and validated [1], and offer the advantage of reducing experimental efforts while providing invaluable insights into structure-property relationships.
In this project, the PPMC progressive damage model was exercised for three and four point bending application to further validate this predictive capability.
