<h6 style="text-align:left">Overview</h6>
<p style="text-align:justify">
NASA has awarded Aerojet Rocketdyne Inc. of Redmond, Washington, a $600M contract for the development of the Orion Main Engine (OME) for Artemix VII through XIV.
The OME is a re-design of the Orbital Maneuvering System Engine (OMS-E) used on the space shuttle.
A team of NASA engineers are working with Aerojet Rocketdyne to successfully deliver a continuous supply of OME for future Artemis missions.
As part of the stress and fracture team, I provide guidance and review documentation to ensure compliance with relevant NASA and industry standards.

<strong>Highlights</strong>:<br>
<ul style="text-align:left;margin-left:30px">
	<li>Ensure OME is compliant with MPCV 72634 - Orion multi-purpose crew vehicle (MPCV) program orion main engine project technical requirements specification (PTRS)</li>
	<li>Review Aerojet Rocketdyne's proposed alternate standards to identify if requirements meet intent of NASA and industry standards</li>
	<li>Participated in preliminary design review and provided feedback to improve stress and fracture analyses</li>
	<li>Participated in incremental critical design review and provided feedback to improve stress and fracture analyses</li>
	<li>Familiar with OME gimbal ring assembly, thrust chamber assembly, propellant lines, flexhoses, and filters, series valve and CCSV, pneumatic package, heat shield and bracket, thermal management system, instrumentation and harnesses, and ancillary system</li>
	<li>Revised and provided inputs to the propulsion subsystem bellows added measures of robustnest (AMOR) requirements</li>
